#### How well does this project leverage a blockchain?

Our project solves an essential privacy issue that can only be solved with blockchain. User privacy is easily achieved with blockchain and encryption, while still allowing companies to conduct valuable market research.

#### UI/UX

_How is the user experience of your application? Could someone with little to no experience in the blockchain space use it easily?_

The flow of the application as a user taking a survey requires very little knowledge of the blockchain space. Aside from acquaintance of BTZ through the Bunz app, users can easily use the survey functionality.
